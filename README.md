# Warehouse Manager

This is a simple wrapper for different cloud storage providers (i.e. Google Drive, Dropbox, Amazon S3, etc...). The goal of this program is to have a unified API for standard BREAD interactions (Browse, Read, Edit, Add, Delete) for each platform.

**This API is still under heavy development.**

So far, only Google Drive is supported, but support for other providers will follow.
